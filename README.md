# Logistic_Regression_in_Machine_Learning
Logistic regression is a classification model that can be used to predict whether it will rain tomorrow based on the given weather observations. In this case, the target variable is "RainTomorrow," which indicates whether it rained the next day (Yes or No).

The logistic regression model works by estimating the probability of an event occurring. In this scenario, it estimates the probability of rain tomorrow. The output of the logistic regression model is a value between 0 and 1, representing the probability of rain. If the probability is above a certain threshold (e.g., 0.5), we can classify it as a positive outcome (rain) or a negative outcome (no rain).

To train the logistic regression model, we would use the historical weather observations as input features and the corresponding "RainTomorrow" values as the target variable. The input features could include various weather attributes such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc., that are available in the dataset.

During the training process, the logistic regression model learns the relationship between the input features and the probability of rain tomorrow. It adjusts its parameters to maximize the likelihood of the observed outcomes. Once trained, the model can then be used to predict the probability of rain for new, unseen weather observations.

To make predictions using the logistic regression model, we would provide the relevant weather information for the following day as input to the model. The model would then output the predicted probability of rain. By applying a threshold, such as 0.5, we can classify the prediction as either rain (if the probability is above the threshold) or no rain (if the probability is below the threshold).

Overall, logistic regression provides a way to model the relationship between weather observations and the likelihood of rain tomorrow. It is a useful tool for binary classification problems, such as predicting whether it will rain or not based on historical weather data.
